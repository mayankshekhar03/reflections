When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use remote repository when I want to work on a repo collaboratively
    with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic pulling is not recommended because if I working on a bug on my local 
    machine and don't want to pull the changes from the GitHub it is easier when the 
    pulling is manual.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork can be used when I want to copy someone elses work to my repositories.
    clone is used when I want to make a copy of exiting repo on GitHub or
    locally.
    braches is used when I want to introduce a new experimental feature into the
    program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is easier to analyse what were the changes made to the repository while 
    I was away and what are the necessary actions that can be taken to resolve 
    conflicts if anyone arises between origin/master and master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaboration can be done using online storage like OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.
    but it would be harder to keep track of the changes to the files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
